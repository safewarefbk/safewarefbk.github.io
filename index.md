## Who we are

**At the SaFEWaRe (Secure Code Lifecycle for Applications and Networking) Research Unit, our mission is to advance 
software security across the entire development lifecycle.**

We pursue this through two main research directions:

1. **Secure Development Practices**: We design tools and methodologies that embed security into every phase of the software 
lifecycle—from design to deployment.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: We ensure that software systems comply with critical international standards and regulations, 
including the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2).

Artificial intelligence plays a dual role in our work:

- **As a challenge**, we focus on securely integrating AI into software systems.

- **As a solution**, we harness AI to enhance software analysis and reduce cyber risks through improved accuracy and 
automation.

Beyond our research, we're proud to collaborate with [Cisco](_collaborations/Cisco.md), actively contributing to the advancement of their optical 
network control plan.

The SaFEWaRe unit lies within the [Cybersecurity center](https://cs.fbk.eu/) in [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu) (FBK).
